# JSON Merger

This program allows you to merge multiple JSON files into a single JSON file. You can specify the files individually, provide a directory containing the JSON files, or use the current directory as the source. The program will merge all the JSON data into one output file.

## Features

- Merge JSON files from a list of filenames, a specified directory, or all JSON files in the current directory.
- Handles both JSON objects and arrays, merging them into a single output file.
- Automatically appends `.json` to the output filename if itâ€™s not provided.
